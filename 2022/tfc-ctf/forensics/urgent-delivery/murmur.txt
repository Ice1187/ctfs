Hi!
I want to tell you a story!
However, if you think you know my secret, feel free to interrupt me at any time and I will give you what you are after.
You can press any key to continue...
hey

you know me?
right?
nvm
...
anyway
a story
that's important right now
SO...
THERE WAS A GUY
NAMED BOB
F*@$ caps lock!
sryq
sry**
my bad
Bob was nice
but he never knew
what the protocols he used...
...did...!
**Dramatic Pause**
DON'T BE LIKE BOB!
Caps intended this time!
...
I have a confession to make
I am like Bob :((
I take a LOT of stuff for granted
And I am too lazy to learn...
...everything :((
DONT'T BE LIKE ME!
That sometimes makes me sad
I am sad
Now :((
When I'm sad
I start drawing
Look!
Here is a cat:
  |\_/|
 / @ @ \
( > 0 < )
  >>x<<
 /  O  \
How did I do?
Bad!!!
I forgot I keep asking for input
so the cat is sliced
I can't even do this right!
FFS
DON'T BE LIKE ME!
again...

aaaanyways
Internet Protocols

Bob is researching flags right now
Same as you
Hmmm
small world I guess
He says there is something URGENT
but not every time
idk
What do you think he is referring to?
Fucking BOB
Damn, I forgot to censor that
anyway, I really need to go
it was fun talking to you! Have fun!
